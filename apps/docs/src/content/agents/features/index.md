# Features Documentation

This section contains documentation for specific features as they are implemented.

## Documents

*No feature docs yet. Create new docs here as features are built.*

### How to Add a Feature Doc

When implementing a new feature, create a doc at `features/<feature-name>.md`:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
slug: features/feature-name
description: Brief description
category: agents
---
```

Include:
- **Purpose** - What problem does this solve?
- **User stories** - Who uses it and how?
- **Technical design** - How is it implemented?
- **API/Events** - SignalR events, REST endpoints
- **State** - What data does it manage?
